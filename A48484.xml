         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>dreſſe of Grievances, and proviſion for Safety: and that the King was but at the moſt the chief publike Officer of this Kingdom, and accomptable to this Houſe (the Repreſentative of the People from whom all juſt Authority is, or ought to be derived) for diſcharge of his Office: And if we had not bin confident hereof, we had not bin deſperately mad to have taken up Armes, or to have <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But when we conſidered the manifold oppreſſions brough<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> upon the Nation, by the King, his Lords and Biſhops; and that this Honourable Houſe declared their deep ſenſe thereof; and that (for continuance of that power which had ſo oppreſt us) it was evident the King intended to raiſe Forces, and to make War; and that if he did ſet up his Standard, it tended to the diſſolution of the Government: upon this, knowing the ſafety of the People to be above Law, and that to judge thereof appertained to the ſupreme Authority, and not to the ſupreme Magiſtrate, and being ſatisfied in our Conſciences, that the publike ſafety and freedom was in imminent danger, we concluded we had not onely a juſt cauſe to maintain; but the ſupreme Authority of the Nation, to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, defend and indempnifie us in time to come, in what we ſhould perform by direction thereof; though the higheſt.</p>
            <p>And as this our underſtanding was begotten in us by princ<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ples of right reaſon, ſo were we confirmed therein by your own proceedings, as by your condemning thoſe Judges who in the caſe of Ship money had declared the King to be Judge of Safety; and by your denying him to have a Negative voice in the making of Lawes; where you wholly exclude the King from having any ſhare in the ſupreme Authority: Then by your caſting the Biſhop out of the Houſe of Lords, who by tradition alſo, had bin accounted an eſſentiall part of the ſupreme Authority; and by your decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the Lords, That if they would not joyn with you in ſ<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">

            </p>
            <p>Theſe things we took for reall Demonſtrations, that you indoubtedly knew your ſelves to be the ſupreme Authority; ever weighing down in us all other your indulgent <hi>Expreſſions concerning the King or Lords;</hi> it being indeed impoſſible for us to believ<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>And when as moſt of the oppreſſions of the Common-wea<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he King, cannot but deem our ſelves in the moſt dangerous condition of all others, left without all plea of indempnity for what we have done; as already many have found by loſſe of their live and liberties, either for things done or ſaid againſt the King; the law of the land frequently taking place, and precedency againſt and before your Authoritie, which we eſteemed ſupreme, and ag<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inſt which no law ought to be pleaded. Nor can we poſſibly conceive how any that have any waies aſſiſted you can be exempt from the guilt of murderers and robbers, by the preſent law<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And whereas a Perſonall Treaty, or any Treaty with the King, hath been long time held forth as the onely means of a ſafe and wel-grounded Peace; it is well known to have been cryed up principally by ſuch as have been alwaies diſ-affected unto you; and though you have not contradicted it, yet it is believed that you much feare the iſſue thereof; as you have cauſe ſufficient, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you ſee greater alteration in the King and his party thee is generally obſerved, there having never yet been any Treaty with him, but was accompanied with ſome underhand-dealing; and whilſt the preſent force upon him (though ſeeming liberty) will in time to come be certainly pleaded, againſt all that ſhall or can be agreed upon: Nay, what can you confide in if you conſider how he hath been provoked; and what former Kings upon <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſſe provocations have done, after Oaths, Laws, Charters, Bonds, Excommunications, and all tyes of Reconciliations, to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all thoſe that had provoked and oppoſed them: ye<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We proſeſſe we cannot chuſe but ſtand amazed to conſider the inevitable danger we ſhall be in, though all things in the Propoſitions were agreed unto; the reſolutions of the King and his party have been ſo perpetually violently and implacably proſecuted and manifeſted againſt us; and that with ſuch ſcorn and indignation, that it muſt be more than ſuch ordinary Bonds that muſt hold them. And it is no leſſe a wonder to us that you can place your own ſecurity therein, or that yon can ever imagin to ſee a free Parliament any more in England.</p>
            <p>The truth is (and we ſee we muſt either now ſpeake it, or for ever be ſilent,) We have long expected things of an other nature from you, and ſuch as we are confident would have given ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to all ſerious people of all Parties. As,
